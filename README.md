## Title
 Porgressive Web Application - Text Editer<br />
  

  ## Description
  The goal of this assignment was to create a text editer application that can be used offline to make notes so as to dislpay how progressive web applications work. To start the application you will run "npm run start" from the root directory and you should be able to see the backend start up. The application uses a webpack plugin to bundle the JavaScript files, generate the HTML file, service worker and mainfest files. Try and use the next-gen JavaScript in the application and it should be able to function in the browser without any errors. The application uses IndexedDB to create the database storage, this way if you enter content in the text editor and click off the DOM window the content can be save there. Finally, I deployed the package on Heroku and until it becomes to expensive to keep up as you can open the application on the deployed link.
